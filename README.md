# DrawingLanguage #

DrawingLanguage is a simple language for drawing simple shapes.

The language is a mix of hierarchical and method-chaining, with fields being accessed through chaining and the overall structure being determined using nested methods.

An example implementation of the usage is provided in ExampleImplementation, the file can simply be run using its main window to see the drawing.
